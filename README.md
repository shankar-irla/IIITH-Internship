# IIIT Hyderabad Internship 2025 - YOLOv8 Object Detection & Segmentation

Welcome to my **IIIT Hyderabad iHub-Data Internship 2025** repository!  
This repo contains all the task solutions and experiments completed as part of the internship, focused on leveraging the **Ultralytics YOLOv8** framework for cutting-edge object detection and segmentation.

---

## About the Project

During this internship, I worked extensively with **YOLOv8** â€” the latest, state-of-the-art model by Ultralytics â€” to build and experiment with custom object detection and segmentation pipelines.  
All tasks were developed and tested in Python using dedicated virtual environments to ensure reproducibility and package management.

## Repository Structure

Each task has its own folder containing:  
- Source code files  
- Input datasets (images/videos)  
- Output results (images, videos, metrics)  
- Documentation and procedure PDFs  

This organization helps maintain clarity and ease of navigation through the internship projects.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: YOLOv8 Object Detection Setup  
- Project setup, environment configuration, and running YOLOv8 nano model on sample images.  
- Verified GPU support and visualized bounding box detections.

### Task 2: Image & Video Segmentation Pipeline  
- Prepared image datasets for segmentation.  
- Applied YOLOv8 segmentation on images and video frames.  
- Used FFmpeg to convert segmented images into videos.

### Task 3: African Wildlife Dataset Analysis  
- Trained YOLOv8n model on a 4-class African wildlife dataset.  
- Evaluated model using confusion matrix, F1-confidence, precision-recall, and other performance curves.  
- Ensured data balance and monitored training convergence.

### Task 4: Custom Object Detection Model Pipeline  
- Collected, labeled, and organized a custom dataset.  
- Created YAML config file for YOLOv8 training.  
- Trained and tested the model, analyzing overfitting due to limited data.

### Task 5: Helmet Detection for Public Safety  
- Implemented helmet detection based on an IEEE research paper.  
- Annotated helmet dataset using Roboflow in YOLOv8 format.  
- Trained YOLOv8 model, monitored training metrics, and evaluated precision and recall.  
- Saved and analyzed prediction outputs.
